# Chain of Density prompting research
Based on the research: From Sparse to Dense. GPT-4 Summarization with Chain of Density Prompting (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04269), working on determining the effectiveness of each step of the CoD prompting approach. 

Chain of Density (CoD) is a technique designed to enhance the summarization abilities of large language models like GPT-4. By regulating the density of information in the generated summary, CoD aims to create well-balanced summaries that effectively capture the essence of complex content. Through specially crafted prompts, the AI model is guided to include crucial points while filtering out extraneous details, ensuring a clear and concise understanding of the original material.
