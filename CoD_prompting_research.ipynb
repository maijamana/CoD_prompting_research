Granted, there\\u2019s scientific research that caffeine fuels the imagination, but doesn\\u2019t the surrounding din interfere with their ability to think creatively such that no amount of chemical stimulation can compensate for the distraction?\\n\\nCertainly, many eminent creatives from the past shunned clamor. Consider Marcel Proust. To remark that the French writer was sensitive to auditory interference would be an understatement. The man was positively neurotic about it. He treated the bedroom in his Paris apartment where he wrote like a sensory deprivation chamber \\u2014 shutters closed, drapes drawn, the walls lined with sound-absorbing cork. It wasn\\u2019t enough. He wore earplugs too.\\n\\nAnton Chekhov was similarly beset by hypersensitivity to sound. So was fellow obsessive Frank Kafka, who described his condition in his signature surreal style by saying that \\u201cI need solitude for my writing; not \\u2018like a hermit\\u2019 \\u2014 that wouldn\\u2019t be enough \\u2014 but like a dead man.\\u201d Sadly, by the time he got his wish, it was too late to do anything about it.\\n\\nThe correlation between high-level inventiveness and difficulty in filtering out sensory inputs is understandable, given that open-mindedness is a hallmark of the creative personality. The problem for off-the-chart geniuses like Proust, Chekhov, and Kafka was that their minds were a bit too open. Everything got through. Hence the extreme measures they took to avoid being immobilized by incoming stimuli.\\n\\nFig. 1: Optimal noise levels for creative processing compared to other conditions. After Ravi Mehta, Rui (Juliet) Zhu, and Amar Cheema (2012). Illustration by the author. From My Creative Space: How to Design Your Home to Stimulate Ideas and Spark Innovation.\\n\\nThen again, most of us aren\\u2019t Marcel Proust. According to research data from 2012, people generally reach peak performance under moderately noisy conditions \\u2014 70db (decibels), to be precise. It just so happens that this is roughly equivalent to the chatter in a typical coffee shop or restaurant on a relatively busy day (Fig. 1).\\n\\nAs to why this is the case, the scientists who authored the study offer a theory:\\n\\nWe theorize that a moderate (vs. low) level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty, which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance. A high level of noise, however, reduces the extent of information processing, thus impairing creativity.\\n\\nTranslation: silence isn\\u2019t as golden as it sounds. Absolute noiselessness tends to focus our attention, which is helpful for tasks that entail accuracy, fine detail, and linear reasoning, such as balancing our checkbook or fixing a Swiss watch. It\\u2019s less supportive of the broad, big-picture, abstract mind-wandering that leads to fresh perspectives and a creative work product. On the other hand, excessive noise overwhelms our sensory apparatus and hinders our ability to properly process information at all. In between lies the sweet spot \\u2014 noise not so loud that we can\\u2019t hear ourselves think, and not so quiet that we can\\u2019t help but hear ourselves think.\\n\\nLiving room and fountain details. Bellevue, Washington. Architecture by David Coleman Architecture. Interior design by Elizabeth Stretch for Stretch Design. Photography by Paul Warchol.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a caveat to the data, however: the noise has to be white. For the record, the technical definition of white noise is noise containing multiple frequencies with equal intensities. More colloquially, the phrase refers to a constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds, and which takes the form of meaningless or distracting commotion, hubbub, or chatter.\\n\\nWhy is it important that the noise be white? Because otherwise you\\u2019re prone to tune into and attempt to discern the source and meaning of the sound, which diverts too much of your conscious attention from your task to be a useful tool for diffuse thinking.\\n\\nHow to Make Noise When There Isn\\u2019t Any\\n\\nHow can we creative mortals who don\\u2019t care for the smell of coffee, lack the funds to construct an oceanside villa, or live in urban environments where trees are scant benefit from the finding that a particular type and level of noise can promote insights? Here are a few options to consider:\\n\\nGet the app. Yes, Virginia, there really is an app for everything. Use the search term \\u201cnoise\\u201d to bring up dozens of sound generating programs in your smartphone\\u2019s app store. You\\u2019ll also see a broad selection of metering apps for measuring decibel levels at home.\\n\\nSome of the app companies operate websites that let you download audio files of white noise soundtracks onto your computer or play them directly through a browser. A couple of my favorite sites include Raining.fm, which offers tracks simulating \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 downpours, rolling thunder, and heavy thunderstorms, and Coffitivy, which specializes in \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 coffee shop buzz.\\n\\nLiving room. Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Architecture and interior design by Richard Davignon and Doris Martin for Davignon Martin Architecture + Interior Design. Photography by Eymeric Widling.\\n\\nGet or hack a sound generator. Another option is to purchase a desktop appliance designed to emit white noise. They\\u2019re smallish devices, typically placed on night tables and in babies\\u2019 rooms to help occupants fall asleep. For an architectural solution, think about installing an indoor or outdoor fountain \\u2014 few things in life are as pleasantly hypnotizing as the mellifluous whoosh of water descending onto water. Price points run the gamut from low-cost store-bought products to sky\\u2019s-the-limit custom installations.\\n\\nDIY contrivances also abound; consult the Internet for guidance.\\n\\nLet in or keep out external noise. City dwellers and people who reside along busy highways might have a ready-made noise machine right outside their window: road traffic. Open your windows to varying degrees or use sound muffling, such as drapery, to see if you can calibrate ambient noise to fall within the optimal range.\\n\\nA less cacophonous strategy for harnessing exterior sounds would be to park yourself on a bench or beach that lies within earshot of ocean waves. It\\u2019s like having an always-on fountain, only bigger.\\n\\nListen to music. Like noise, music can have a positive effect on idea formation, while affording the listener far greater pleasure than the usual restaurant ruckus. But music is a huge subject in itself, and so must wait for another article!\",\n          \"An introvert is a person who recharges when they are alone. Being around other people depletes their energy, being by themselves renews it.\\n\\nWriting is such solitary, interior work that it tends to attract introverts. We work well alone. And if we happen to have a little bit of ambivert in us \\u2014 if we like to be around other people some \\u2014 well, that\\u2019s okay. We have our characters to keep us company.\\n\\nBut it\\u2019s very, very rare to find a writer who gets excited about the part of the business of writing that requires a more extroverted personality. You know, the part where you have to stick your nose out of your writing cave and let other humans know you\\u2019re alive.\\n\\nUh, huh. Marketing.\\n\\nUgh. Marketing. It\\u2019s hard for everyone, but for introverts? For introverts, marketing is torture.\\n\\nEvery now and then I come across someone for whom the stars have aligned and they\\u2019ve managed to find success (sometimes incredible success) without the need for a lot of marketing and they just kind of shrug and say Oh, marketing? I don\\u2019t like it, so I just don\\u2019t do it. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s necessary.\\n\\nAnd I want to throat punch them. Metaphorically. Because I wouldn\\u2019t really throat punch anyone. I\\u2019m a pacifist.\\n\\nBut come on.\\n\\nOne percent of writers write the right thing at the right time and get it out in the right place, in front of the right people, and bam! Magic happens. They get rich and famous and they never have to market anything.\\n\\nHow nice for them. But counting on being one of those people is not a very good career plan.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s kind of like deciding you want to be an actress, so you start to hang out in soda shops, hoping to be discovered because it worked for Lana Turner.\\n\\nI really wish that the people who managed to find their way onto that magical path would at least acknowledge that it probably won\\u2019t work for almost anyone else. Because it won\\u2019t.\\n\\nNinety-nine percent of writers have to learn how to market, even if they are introverts who would rather seriously consider a career in accounting than think about marketing their own work.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what you need to know about marketing.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nMarketing is just a conversation between you and your readers. If you can remember that, then you can manage your fear about it. It\\u2019s not a magic trick. It\\u2019s not a technique or a tactic or a strategy.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s just a conversation.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s you reaching out to readers who are into what you\\u2019re writing and letting them know that you\\u2019ve written a thing that they might be interested in. That\\u2019s all. And that\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nWhen you post a link to social media, you aren\\u2019t bothering anyone. You\\u2019re giving other people the opportunity to read something they might enjoy. If they aren\\u2019t into it, they\\u2019ll scroll past. No harm done.\\n\\nAnd trust me, they\\u2019ll scroll. (Same as you scroll past hundreds of links a day. Maybe thousands.)\\n\\nWhen you run an ad, you\\u2019re reaching out to other people just like you.\\n\\nYou aren\\u2019t shoving your work up their noses. You aren\\u2019t being pushy or obnoxious. You\\u2019re doing what you\\u2019re supposed to do. You\\u2019re letting readers know that you\\u2019ve written something for them.\\n\\nAnd if you do it right, you\\u2019re letting readers who have asked to be made aware know that you\\u2019ve written something. You\\u2019re not bombarding everyone in creation. You\\u2019re putting your link in front of people who follow you or who have read other things like what you\\u2019ve written or who are interested in your topic.\\n\\nDeep breath. This is part of your job, and it\\u2019s okay to do it.\\n\\nReaders are just people.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s all. They are just human beings, same as you.\\n\\nAnd, here\\u2019s the cool part. The ones you most want to reach are probably a lot like you. If you\\u2019ve written a book, it\\u2019s probably the kind of book you like to read. And if you\\u2019d like to read it, then that means that other people like you would probably like to read it.\\n\\nSo all you have to do is think for a minute about how someone who has written a book like yours could reach you.\\n\\nWhat would make you want to read your own book?\\n\\nWhat makes you tell a friend oh, my God, you have to read this?\\n\\nWhat makes you click a link, instead of scrolling by?\\n\\nWhat makes you share?\\n\\nThe reason why marketing gets a bad rap is because so many people use it like a sledgehammer, when really, it\\u2019s more like a Post-it note. No one wants to get smashed over the head. But who doesn\\u2019t want the exact right thing stuck right where they need it?\\n\\nIntroverts have trouble being sledgehammers. All we want to do is go home and get in our pajamas! We don\\u2019t want to hit anyone over the head with our books or anything else.\\n\\nBut we can stick a little reminder in the right place. A friendly little note that says Oh, hi! I wrote this thing. I think you\\u2019re going to love it.\\n\\nAnd sometimes the sledgehammer is easy to ignore \\u2014 because we\\u2019re so used to dodging them. But those sticky notes, man. If you use them right, they\\u2019re wonderful. They make you pay attention.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t be slimy.\\n\\nThis should be obvious, but we both know it\\u2019s not.\\n\\nWe know, because there are so many people out there willing to take $299 from us to teach us how to be slimy.\\n\\nYou don\\u2019t have to trick people into buying your book. You don\\u2019t have to slip in under the radar. You don\\u2019t need to get fake bestseller statuses or elevate your social validation or whatever.\\n\\nAuthenticity is addictive. It\\u2019s your best asset.\\n\\nWhen you spend money, make it count.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re an indie writer, learn how to use Amazon ads properly. Dave Chesson has a free course in how to that over at Kindlepreneur.\\n\\nThe best money you can spend as a writer is on a decent email server. I like Convertkit. Start building your email list today. I\\u2019ve written a ton about email list building for writers, but you can start here.\\n\\nBryan Harris at Growth Tools (they used to be Videofruit) has a ton of amazing ideas for email list building that he offers for free. Just free. When I first started, I just took Bryan\\u2019s ideas one at a time and did the work.\\n\\nIt was hard. Because I\\u2019m an introvert and none of this shit is easy for me. But I did it and it worked. And it got easier.\\n\\nYou do not need to spend a lot of money on fancy ads or on schemes to make yourself a \\u201cbestseller\\u201d in a boxed set or hiring publicists. You do not need more than a simple website that you are probably capable of building yourself .\\n\\nHello, there. You should be blogging.\\n\\nYou\\u2019re a writer. Words are your currency and your most available tool.\\n\\nI feel like I\\u2019m stating the obvious here, but you should be blogging.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re a novelist, you might get a book into your reader\\u2019s hands once a year give or take. Maybe. But with a blog, you can reach out to your readers any time you want to. Every week. Every day. Every time you have an idea.\\n\\nYou can be in conversation with them. And let me tell you, that\\u2019s some exciting stuff. It\\u2019s thrilling. If you give you readers a way to start following you, you\\u2019ll start to notice that some of them are hardcore. They always show up for you.\\n\\nThey read what you write. They always read what you write.\\n\\nIf you have any doubt that your introverted self needs that, let me help you put that at rest.\\n\\nYou need it. Everyone needs it. It\\u2019s the good stuff.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. It\\u2019s why you\\u2019re reading this article instead of happily writing in your journal or filing your short stories away on your hard drive.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why you care whether or not anyone reads your work.\\n\\nWhile we\\u2019re on the subject, please do not only blog about your own writing. No one wants to read that. It\\u2019s boring.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t believe me, ask yourself this question: How many author blogs do you read that only talk about the author\\u2019s process?\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nYou are an interesting person. There are things you\\u2019re interested in. You\\u2019re good at things. There are things you want to be good at. Write about those things.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find your people. I promise.\\n\\nRemember that marketing has nothing to do with the quality of your work.\\n\\nIf you find yourself saying if I was good enough, I wouldn\\u2019t need to market I want you to do something for me.\\n\\nGo to a mirror and look yourself squarely in the face. Now tell yourself to stop it. Right now.\\n\\nYou are wrong. And I swear, this is one of those times when if everyone would just listen to me, the world would be a happier place. Because there is exactly zero correlation between the quality of your work and the necessity for marketing.\\n\\nThe fact that you need to market your work does not mean that you\\u2019re a shitty writer, just because you heard once that someone else doesn\\u2019t have an email list and never markets anything.\\n\\nEveryone needs to market their work.

Spoiler: they said everything\\u2019s cool.\\n\\nBy Chloe Albanesius & Michael Kan\\n\\nThe CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.\\n\\nSpoiler: They all said they don\\u2019t.\\n\\nAs you\\u2019d expect, Apple\\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn\\u2019t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.\\n\\nMembers on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook\\u2019s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple\\u2019s fabled walled-garden approach persists.\\n\\nSome Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon\\u2019s JEDI project; and why a certain member\\u2019s campaign emails keep ending up in his father\\u2019s spam folder.\\n\\nThe four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nFacebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?\\n\\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.\\n\\n\\u201cIn your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,\\u201d Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. \\u201cWhy should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. \\u201cI think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would\\u2019ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\\u201d he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.\\n\\nAccording to Zuckerberg, Instagram\\u2019s success is largely due to Facebook\\u2019s investment. \\u201cI think this has been an American success story,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nNadler disagreed. \\u201cRather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\\n\\nAre You Threatening Me?\\n\\nNadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg\\u2019s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.\\n\\n\\u201cIn a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook \\u2018was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,\\u2019\\u201d Rep. Jayapal noted. \\u201cInstagram\\u2019s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into \\u2018destroy mode\\u2019 if he didn\\u2019t sell Instagram to you.\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. \\u201cI think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nPreventing Imminent Risk of Life\\n\\nTwitter was not present at today\\u2019s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president\\u2019s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.\\n\\nThe video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn\\u2019t one, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\\u201cIn general\\u2026we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,\\u201d Zuckerberg continued. But if \\u201csomeone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug \\u2026 we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.\\u201d\\n\\nLater in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.\\n\\n\\u201cWe believe in freedom of expression and there\\u2019s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,\\u201d Pichai said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Text_Splitted\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"As an architect and the author of a book about the psychology of creative space design, I have long wondered why contemporary creatives cluster so willingly in noisy coffee shops. Granted, there\\u2019s scientific research that caffeine fuels the imagination, but doesn\\u2019t the surrounding din interfere with their ability to think creatively such that no amount of chemical stimulation can compensate for the distraction?\\n\\nCertainly, many eminent creatives from the past shunned clamor. Consider Marcel Proust. To remark that the French writer was sensitive to auditory interference would be an understatement. The man was positively neurotic about it. He treated the bedroom in his Paris apartment where he wrote like a sensory deprivation chamber \\u2014 shutters closed, drapes drawn, the walls lined with sound-absorbing cork. It wasn\\u2019t enough. He wore earplugs too.\\n\\nAnton Chekhov was similarly beset by hypersensitivity to sound. So was fellow obsessive Frank Kafka, who described his condition in his signature surreal style by saying that \\u201cI need solitude for my writing; not \\u2018like a hermit\\u2019 \\u2014 that wouldn\\u2019t be enough \\u2014 but like a dead man.\\u201d Sadly, by the time he got his wish, it was too late to do anything about it.\\n\\nThe correlation between high-level inventiveness and difficulty in filtering out sensory inputs is understandable, given that open-mindedness is a hallmark of the creative personality. The problem for off-the-chart geniuses like Proust, Chekhov, and Kafka was that their minds were a bit too open. Everything got through. Hence the extreme measures they took to avoid being immobilized by incoming stimuli.\\n\\nFig. 1: Optimal noise levels for creative processing compared to other conditions. After Ravi Mehta, Rui (Juliet) Zhu, and Amar Cheema (2012). Illustration by the author. From My Creative Space: How to Design Your Home to Stimulate Ideas and Spark Innovation.\\n\\nThen again, most of us aren\\u2019t Marcel Proust. According to research data from 2012, people generally reach peak performance under moderately noisy conditions \\u2014 70db (decibels), to be precise. It just so happens that this is roughly equivalent to the chatter in a typical coffee shop or restaurant on a relatively busy day (Fig. 1).\\n\\nAs to why this is the case, the scientists who authored the study offer a theory:\\n\\nWe theorize that a moderate (vs. low) level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty, which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance. A high level of noise, however, reduces the extent of information processing, thus impairing creativity.\\n\\nTranslation: silence isn\\u2019t as golden as it sounds. Absolute noiselessness tends to focus our attention, which is helpful for tasks that entail accuracy, fine detail, and linear reasoning, such as balancing our checkbook or fixing a Swiss watch. It\\u2019s less supportive of the broad, big-picture, abstract mind-wandering that leads to fresh perspectives and a creative work product. On the other hand, excessive noise overwhelms our sensory apparatus and hinders our ability to properly process information at all. In between lies the sweet spot \\u2014 noise not so loud that we can\\u2019t hear ourselves think, and not so quiet that we can\\u2019t help but hear ourselves think.\\n\\nLiving room and fountain details. Bellevue, Washington. Architecture by David Coleman Architecture. Interior design by Elizabeth Stretch for Stretch Design. Photography by Paul Warchol.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a caveat to the data, however: the noise has to be white. For the record, the technical definition of white noise is noise containing multiple frequencies with equal intensities. More colloquially, the phrase refers to a constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds, and which takes the form of meaningless or distracting commotion, hubbub, or chatter.\\n\\nWhy is it important that the noise be white? Because otherwise you\\u2019re prone to tune into and attempt to discern the source and meaning of the sound, which diverts too much of your conscious attention from your task to be a useful tool for diffuse thinking.\\n\\nHow to Make Noise When There Isn\\u2019t Any\\n\\nHow can we creative mortals who don\\u2019t care for the smell of coffee, lack the funds to construct an oceanside villa, or live in urban environments where trees are scant benefit from the finding that a particular type and level of noise can promote insights? Here are a few options to consider:\\n\\nGet the app. Yes, Virginia, there really is an app for everything. Use the search term \\u201cnoise\\u201d to bring up dozens of sound generating programs in your smartphone\\u2019s app store. You\\u2019ll also see a broad selection of metering apps for measuring decibel levels at home.\\n\\nSome of the app companies operate websites that let you download audio files of white noise soundtracks onto your computer or play them directly through a browser. A couple of my favorite sites include Raining.fm, which offers tracks simulating \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 downpours, rolling thunder, and heavy thunderstorms, and Coffitivy, which specializes in \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 coffee shop buzz.\\n\\nLiving room. Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Architecture and interior design by Richard Davignon and Doris Martin for Davignon Martin Architecture + Interior Design. Photography by Eymeric Widling.\\n\\nGet or hack a sound generator. Another option is to purchase a desktop appliance designed to emit white noise. They\\u2019re smallish devices, typically placed on night tables and in babies\\u2019 rooms to help occupants fall asleep. For an architectural solution, think about installing an indoor or outdoor fountain \\u2014 few things in life are as pleasantly hypnotizing as the mellifluous whoosh of water descending onto water. Price points run the gamut from low-cost store-bought products to sky\\u2019s-the-limit custom installations.\\n\\nDIY contrivances also abound; consult the Internet for guidance.\\n\\nLet in or keep out external noise. City dwellers and people who reside along busy highways might have a ready-made noise machine right outside their window: road traffic. Open your windows to varying degrees or use sound muffling, such as drapery, to see if you can calibrate ambient noise to fall within the optimal range.\\n\\nA less cacophonous strategy for harnessing exterior sounds would be to park yourself on a bench or beach that lies within earshot of ocean waves. It\\u2019s like having an always-on fountain, only bigger.\\n\\nListen to music. Like noise, music can have a positive effect on idea formation, while affording the listener far greater pleasure than the usual restaurant ruckus. But music is a huge subject in itself, and so must wait for another article!\",\n          \"An introvert is a person who recharges when they are alone. Being around other people depletes their energy, being by themselves renews it.\\n\\nWriting is such solitary, interior work that it tends to attract introverts. We work well alone. And if we happen to have a little bit of ambivert in us \\u2014 if we like to be around other people some \\u2014 well, that\\u2019s okay. We have our characters to keep us company.\\n\\nBut it\\u2019s very, very rare to find a writer who gets excited about the part of the business of writing that requires a more extroverted personality. You know, the part where you have to stick your nose out of your writing cave and let other humans know you\\u2019re alive.\\n\\nUh, huh. Marketing.\\n\\nUgh. Marketing. It\\u2019s hard for everyone, but for introverts? For introverts, marketing is torture.\\n\\nEvery now and then I come across someone for whom the stars have aligned and they\\u2019ve managed to find success (sometimes incredible success) without the need for a lot of marketing and they just kind of shrug and say Oh, marketing? I don\\u2019t like it, so I just don\\u2019t do it. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s necessary.\\n\\nAnd I want to throat punch them. Metaphorically. Because I wouldn\\u2019t really throat punch anyone. I\\u2019m a pacifist.\\n\\nBut come on.\\n\\nOne percent of writers write the right thing at the right time and get it out in the right place, in front of the right people, and bam! Magic happens. They get rich and famous and they never have to market anything.\\n\\nHow nice for them. But counting on being one of those people is not a very good career plan.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s kind of like deciding you want to be an actress, so you start to hang out in soda shops, hoping to be discovered because it worked for Lana Turner.\\n\\nI really wish that the people who managed to find their way onto that magical path would at least acknowledge that it probably won\\u2019t work for almost anyone else. Because it won\\u2019t.\\n\\nNinety-nine percent of writers have to learn how to market, even if they are introverts who would rather seriously consider a career in accounting than think about marketing their own work.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what you need to know about marketing.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nMarketing is just a conversation between you and your readers. If you can remember that, then you can manage your fear about it. It\\u2019s not a magic trick. It\\u2019s not a technique or a tactic or a strategy.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s just a conversation.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s you reaching out to readers who are into what you\\u2019re writing and letting them know that you\\u2019ve written a thing that they might be interested in. That\\u2019s all. And that\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nWhen you post a link to social media, you aren\\u2019t bothering anyone. You\\u2019re giving other people the opportunity to read something they might enjoy. If they aren\\u2019t into it, they\\u2019ll scroll past. No harm done.\\n\\nAnd trust me, they\\u2019ll scroll. (Same as you scroll past hundreds of links a day. Maybe thousands.)\\n\\nWhen you run an ad, you\\u2019re reaching out to other people just like you.\\n\\nYou aren\\u2019t shoving your work up their noses. You aren\\u2019t being pushy or obnoxious. You\\u2019re doing what you\\u2019re supposed to do. You\\u2019re letting readers know that you\\u2019ve written something for them.\\n\\nAnd if you do it right, you\\u2019re letting readers who have asked to be made aware know that you\\u2019ve written something. You\\u2019re not bombarding everyone in creation. You\\u2019re putting your link in front of people who follow you or who have read other things like what you\\u2019ve written or who are interested in your topic.\\n\\nDeep breath. This is part of your job, and it\\u2019s okay to do it.\\n\\nReaders are just people.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s all. They are just human beings, same as you.\\n\\nAnd, here\\u2019s the cool part. The ones you most want to reach are probably a lot like you. If you\\u2019ve written a book, it\\u2019s probably the kind of book you like to read. And if you\\u2019d like to read it, then that means that other people like you would probably like to read it.\\n\\nSo all you have to do is think for a minute about how someone who has written a book like yours could reach you.\\n\\nWhat would make you want to read your own book?\\n\\nWhat makes you tell a friend oh, my God, you have to read this?\\n\\nWhat makes you click a link, instead of scrolling by?\\n\\nWhat makes you share?\\n\\nThe reason why marketing gets a bad rap is because so many people use it like a sledgehammer, when really, it\\u2019s more like a Post-it note. No one wants to get smashed over the head. But who doesn\\u2019t want the exact right thing stuck right where they need it?\\n\\nIntroverts have trouble being sledgehammers. All we want to do is go home and get in our pajamas! We don\\u2019t want to hit anyone over the head with our books or anything else.\\n\\nBut we can stick a little reminder in the right place. A friendly little note that says Oh, hi! I wrote this thing. I think you\\u2019re going to love it.\\n\\nAnd sometimes the sledgehammer is easy to ignore \\u2014 because we\\u2019re so used to dodging them. But those sticky notes, man. If you use them right, they\\u2019re wonderful. They make you pay attention.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t be slimy.\\n\\nThis should be obvious, but we both know it\\u2019s not.\\n\\nWe know, because there are so many people out there willing to take $299 from us to teach us how to be slimy.\\n\\nYou don\\u2019t have to trick people into buying your book. You don\\u2019t have to slip in under the radar. You don\\u2019t need to get fake bestseller statuses or elevate your social validation or whatever.\\n\\nAuthenticity is addictive. It\\u2019s your best asset.\\n\\nWhen you spend money, make it count.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re an indie writer, learn how to use Amazon ads properly. Dave Chesson has a free course in how to that over at Kindlepreneur.\\n\\nThe best money you can spend as a writer is on a decent email server. I like Convertkit. Start building your email list today. I\\u2019ve written a ton about email list building for writers, but you can start here.\\n\\nBryan Harris at Growth Tools (they used to be Videofruit) has a ton of amazing ideas for email list building that he offers for free. Just free. When I first started, I just took Bryan\\u2019s ideas one at a time and did the work.\\n\\nIt was hard. Because I\\u2019m an introvert and none of this shit is easy for me. But I did it and it worked. And it got easier.\\n\\nYou do not need to spend a lot of money on fancy ads or on schemes to make yourself a \\u201cbestseller\\u201d in a boxed set or hiring publicists. You do not need more than a simple website that you are probably capable of building yourself .\\n\\nHello, there. You should be blogging.\\n\\nYou\\u2019re a writer. Words are your currency and your most available tool.\\n\\nI feel like I\\u2019m stating the obvious here, but you should be blogging.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re a novelist, you might get a book into your reader\\u2019s hands once a year give or take. Maybe. But with a blog, you can reach out to your readers any time you want to. Every week. Every day. Every time you have an idea.\\n\\nYou can be in conversation with them. And let me tell you, that\\u2019s some exciting stuff. It\\u2019s thrilling. If you give you readers a way to start following you, you\\u2019ll start to notice that some of them are hardcore. They always show up for you.\\n\\nThey read what you write. They always read what you write.\\n\\nIf you have any doubt that your introverted self needs that, let me help you put that at rest.\\n\\nYou need it. Everyone needs it. It\\u2019s the good stuff.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. It\\u2019s why you\\u2019re reading this article instead of happily writing in your journal or filing your short stories away on your hard drive.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why you care whether or not anyone reads your work.\\n\\nWhile we\\u2019re on the subject, please do not only blog about your own writing. No one wants to read that. It\\u2019s boring.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t believe me, ask yourself this question: How many author blogs do you read that only talk about the author\\u2019s process?\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nYou are an interesting person. There are things you\\u2019re interested in. You\\u2019re good at things. There are things you want to be good at. Write about those things.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find your people. I promise.\\n\\nRemember that marketing has nothing to do with the quality of your work.\\n\\nIf you find yourself saying if I was good enough, I wouldn\\u2019t need to market I want you to do something for me.\\n\\nGo to a mirror and look yourself squarely in the face. Now tell yourself to stop it. Right now.\\n\\nYou are wrong. And I swear, this is one of those times when if everyone would just listen to me, the world would be a happier place. Because there is exactly zero correlation between the quality of your work and the necessity for marketing.\\n\\nThe fact that you need to market your work does not mean that you\\u2019re a shitty writer, just because you heard once that someone else doesn\\u2019t have an email list and never markets anything.\\n\\nEveryone needs to market their work. The very, very few lucky souls who have somehow been able to count on luck to give them a career \\u2014 we can\\u2019t recreate their success.\\n\\nHell, they can\\u2019t recreate their success.\\n\\nThat means that you\\u2019re normal and they\\u2019re weird.\\n\\nSince you can\\u2019t predict being at the exact right place at the exact right time with the exact right piece of work \\u2014 you\\u2019re going to have to count on your own ability to let people know you\\u2019ve written a thing.\\n\\nIf you do manage to get struck by lightning, awesome. But two things. One \\u2014 since you didn\\u2019t hitch your wagon to that star, you won\\u2019t be dependent on it, so if at some point it stops dragging you along, you\\u2019ll be fine. Two \\u2014 even those lucky few who don\\u2019t have to market their work would do even better if they knew how to reach out to their readers.\\n\\nI mean, do you really, really want to be the writer who gets to be famous and never has to interact with the people who love them? Are you sure about that?\\n\\nBecause that sounds pretty lonely to me. There\\u2019s a difference between lonely and introverted.\\n\\nIt also sounds like the excuse we use to let ourselves off the marketing hook because marketing is hard, especially for introverts, and we don\\u2019t want to do it.\\n\\nThe need to market your work doesn\\u2019t make you less of a writer, because there is no correlation between the quality of your writing and the need or lack of need for marketing.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t believe me, go pick up a copy of 50 Shades of Grey. Or go pick up any National Book Award winner that\\u2019s sold less than 5000 copies.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s okay to focus on the parts that are easier for you.\\n\\nI like blogging. I\\u2019m pretty good at Facebook. I adore my email list. Email marketing is my sweetspot. When I reach out to my email list, I feel like I\\u2019m talking to friends.\\n\\nI suck at video, but I\\u2019m working at it and I\\u2019m getting better. If there are other people there, I can do it pretty well. I still haven\\u2019t mastered video when it\\u2019s just me talking into a camera. I end up sounding like a lunatic.\\n\\nI can do an ad if I have to, but I\\u2019m not a great copywriter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s my skillset. Yours is probably different.\\n\\nAnd that\\u2019s okay. No one is good at everything. And no one has to be.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re great at audio, then do audio. If video is your thing, figure out how to market with video. If you\\u2019re completely inexperienced, pick something and just start. It\\u2019s okay if you suck at the beginning.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a secret for you: in the beginning, no one\\u2019s paying attention anyway.\\n\\nThe few people who will see your early efforts at marketing won\\u2019t care if you screw up. So take a deep breath and don\\u2019t worry so much. Stick your nose out of your introverted writer\\u2019s lair and accept that you\\u2019re going to have to give some form of marketing a shot.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll get better at this.\\n\\nIt might not seem like it now, but marketing is a skill and like any other skill, the more you do it, the better you\\u2019ll get at it. Even if the idea of marketing makes you want to hide under your covers.\\n\\nEventually you\\u2019ll understand how ads work. You\\u2019ll be a master blogger. You\\u2019ll know how to write an email to your followers without sounding like a robot. You\\u2019ll look up one day and realize that you actually like that conversation between you and your readers.\\n\\nMaybe it won\\u2019t ever be your favorite thing. Maybe you\\u2019ll dream about the day when you\\u2019re rich and famous enough to pass it off to someone else. (But, when you get there, you\\u2019ll only have more marketing to do!)\\n\\nBut you will get better at it.\\n\\nHere are a few first steps.\",\n          \"Apple\\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg beamed into a congressional hearing via video chat today to face 4+ hours of questions about whether they abuse their dominant positions in the market. Spoiler: they said everything\\u2019s cool.\\n\\nBy Chloe Albanesius & Michael Kan\\n\\nThe CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.\\n\\nSpoiler: They all said they don\\u2019t.\\n\\nAs you\\u2019d expect, Apple\\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn\\u2019t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.\\n\\nMembers on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook\\u2019s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple\\u2019s fabled walled-garden approach persists.\\n\\nSome Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon\\u2019s JEDI project; and why a certain member\\u2019s campaign emails keep ending up in his father\\u2019s spam folder.\\n\\nThe four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nFacebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?\\n\\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.\\n\\n\\u201cIn your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,\\u201d Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. \\u201cWhy should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. \\u201cI think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would\\u2019ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\\u201d he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.\\n\\nAccording to Zuckerberg, Instagram\\u2019s success is largely due to Facebook\\u2019s investment. \\u201cI think this has been an American success story,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nNadler disagreed. \\u201cRather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\\n\\nAre You Threatening Me?\\n\\nNadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg\\u2019s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.\\n\\n\\u201cIn a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook \\u2018was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,\\u2019\\u201d Rep. Jayapal noted. \\u201cInstagram\\u2019s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into \\u2018destroy mode\\u2019 if he didn\\u2019t sell Instagram to you.\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. \\u201cI think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nPreventing Imminent Risk of Life\\n\\nTwitter was not present at today\\u2019s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president\\u2019s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.\\n\\nThe video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn\\u2019t one, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\\u201cIn general\\u2026we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,\\u201d Zuckerberg continued. But if \\u201csomeone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug \\u2026 we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.\\u201d\\n\\nLater in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.\\n\\n\\u201cWe believe in freedom of expression and there\\u2019s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,\\u201d Pichai said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Granted, there\\u2019s scientific research that caffeine fuels the imagination, but doesn\\u2019t the surrounding din interfere with their ability to think creatively such that no amount of chemical stimulation can compensate for the distraction?\\n\\nCertainly, many eminent creatives from the past shunned clamor. Consider Marcel Proust. To remark that the French writer was sensitive to auditory interference would be an understatement. The man was positively neurotic about it. He treated the bedroom in his Paris apartment where he wrote like a sensory deprivation chamber \\u2014 shutters closed, drapes drawn, the walls lined with sound-absorbing cork. It wasn\\u2019t enough. He wore earplugs too.\\n\\nAnton Chekhov was similarly beset by hypersensitivity to sound. So was fellow obsessive Frank Kafka, who described his condition in his signature surreal style by saying that \\u201cI need solitude for my writing; not \\u2018like a hermit\\u2019 \\u2014 that wouldn\\u2019t be enough \\u2014 but like a dead man.\\u201d Sadly, by the time he got his wish, it was too late to do anything about it.\\n\\nThe correlation between high-level inventiveness and difficulty in filtering out sensory inputs is understandable, given that open-mindedness is a hallmark of the creative personality. The problem for off-the-chart geniuses like Proust, Chekhov, and Kafka was that their minds were a bit too open. Everything got through. Hence the extreme measures they took to avoid being immobilized by incoming stimuli.\\n\\nFig. 1: Optimal noise levels for creative processing compared to other conditions. After Ravi Mehta, Rui (Juliet) Zhu, and Amar Cheema (2012). Illustration by the author. From My Creative Space: How to Design Your Home to Stimulate Ideas and Spark Innovation.\\n\\nThen again, most of us aren\\u2019t Marcel Proust. According to research data from 2012, people generally reach peak performance under moderately noisy conditions \\u2014 70db (decibels), to be precise. It just so happens that this is roughly equivalent to the chatter in a typical coffee shop or restaurant on a relatively busy day (Fig. 1).\\n\\nAs to why this is the case, the scientists who authored the study offer a theory:\\n\\nWe theorize that a moderate (vs. low) level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty, which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance. A high level of noise, however, reduces the extent of information processing, thus impairing creativity.\\n\\nTranslation: silence isn\\u2019t as golden as it sounds. Absolute noiselessness tends to focus our attention, which is helpful for tasks that entail accuracy, fine detail, and linear reasoning, such as balancing our checkbook or fixing a Swiss watch. It\\u2019s less supportive of the broad, big-picture, abstract mind-wandering that leads to fresh perspectives and a creative work product. On the other hand, excessive noise overwhelms our sensory apparatus and hinders our ability to properly process information at all. In between lies the sweet spot \\u2014 noise not so loud that we can\\u2019t hear ourselves think, and not so quiet that we can\\u2019t help but hear ourselves think.\\n\\nLiving room and fountain details. Bellevue, Washington. Architecture by David Coleman Architecture. Interior design by Elizabeth Stretch for Stretch Design. Photography by Paul Warchol.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a caveat to the data, however: the noise has to be white. For the record, the technical definition of white noise is noise containing multiple frequencies with equal intensities. More colloquially, the phrase refers to a constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds, and which takes the form of meaningless or distracting commotion, hubbub, or chatter.\\n\\nWhy is it important that the noise be white? Because otherwise you\\u2019re prone to tune into and attempt to discern the source and meaning of the sound, which diverts too much of your conscious attention from your task to be a useful tool for diffuse thinking.\\n\\nHow to Make Noise When There Isn\\u2019t Any\\n\\nHow can we creative mortals who don\\u2019t care for the smell of coffee, lack the funds to construct an oceanside villa, or live in urban environments where trees are scant benefit from the finding that a particular type and level of noise can promote insights? Here are a few options to consider:\\n\\nGet the app. Yes, Virginia, there really is an app for everything. Use the search term \\u201cnoise\\u201d to bring up dozens of sound generating programs in your smartphone\\u2019s app store. You\\u2019ll also see a broad selection of metering apps for measuring decibel levels at home.\\n\\nSome of the app companies operate websites that let you download audio files of white noise soundtracks onto your computer or play them directly through a browser. A couple of my favorite sites include Raining.fm, which offers tracks simulating \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 downpours, rolling thunder, and heavy thunderstorms, and Coffitivy, which specializes in \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 coffee shop buzz.\\n\\nLiving room. Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Architecture and interior design by Richard Davignon and Doris Martin for Davignon Martin Architecture + Interior Design. Photography by Eymeric Widling.\\n\\nGet or hack a sound generator. Another option is to purchase a desktop appliance designed to emit white noise. They\\u2019re smallish devices, typically placed on night tables and in babies\\u2019 rooms to help occupants fall asleep. For an architectural solution, think about installing an indoor or outdoor fountain \\u2014 few things in life are as pleasantly hypnotizing as the mellifluous whoosh of water descending onto water. Price points run the gamut from low-cost store-bought products to sky\\u2019s-the-limit custom installations.\\n\\nDIY contrivances also abound; consult the Internet for guidance.\\n\\nLet in or keep out external noise. City dwellers and people who reside along busy highways might have a ready-made noise machine right outside their window: road traffic. Open your windows to varying degrees or use sound muffling, such as drapery, to see if you can calibrate ambient noise to fall within the optimal range.\\n\\nA less cacophonous strategy for harnessing exterior sounds would be to park yourself on a bench or beach that lies within earshot of ocean waves. It\\u2019s like having an always-on fountain, only bigger.\\n\\nListen to music. Like noise, music can have a positive effect on idea formation, while affording the listener far greater pleasure than the usual restaurant ruckus. But music is a huge subject in itself, and so must wait for another article!\",\n          \"An introvert is a person who recharges when they are alone. Being around other people depletes their energy, being by themselves renews it.\\n\\nWriting is such solitary, interior work that it tends to attract introverts. We work well alone. And if we happen to have a little bit of ambivert in us \\u2014 if we like to be around other people some \\u2014 well, that\\u2019s okay.

I\\u2019m a pacifist.\\n\\nBut come on.\\n\\nOne percent of writers write the right thing at the right time and get it out in the right place, in front of the right people, and bam! Magic happens. They get rich and famous and they never have to market anything.\\n\\nHow nice for them. But counting on being one of those people is not a very good career plan.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s kind of like deciding you want to be an actress, so you start to hang out in soda shops, hoping to be discovered because it worked for Lana Turner.\\n\\nI really wish that the people who managed to find their way onto that magical path would at least acknowledge that it probably won\\u2019t work for almost anyone else. Because it won\\u2019t.\\n\\nNinety-nine percent of writers have to learn how to market, even if they are introverts who would rather seriously consider a career in accounting than think about marketing their own work.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what you need to know about marketing.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nMarketing is just a conversation between you and your readers. If you can remember that, then you can manage your fear about it. It\\u2019s not a magic trick. It\\u2019s not a technique or a tactic or a strategy.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s just a conversation.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s you reaching out to readers who are into what you\\u2019re writing and letting them know that you\\u2019ve written a thing that they might be interested in. That\\u2019s all. And that\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nWhen you post a link to social media, you aren\\u2019t bothering anyone. You\\u2019re giving other people the opportunity to read something they might enjoy. If they aren\\u2019t into it, they\\u2019ll scroll past. No harm done.\\n\\nAnd trust me, they\\u2019ll scroll. (Same as you scroll past hundreds of links a day. Maybe thousands.)\\n\\nWhen you run an ad, you\\u2019re reaching out to other people just like you.\\n\\nYou aren\\u2019t shoving your work up their noses. You aren\\u2019t being pushy or obnoxious. You\\u2019re doing what you\\u2019re supposed to do. You\\u2019re letting readers know that you\\u2019ve written something for them.\\n\\nAnd if you do it right, you\\u2019re letting readers who have asked to be made aware know that you\\u2019ve written something. You\\u2019re not bombarding everyone in creation. You\\u2019re putting your link in front of people who follow you or who have read other things like what you\\u2019ve written or who are interested in your topic.\\n\\nDeep breath. This is part of your job, and it\\u2019s okay to do it.\\n\\nReaders are just people.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s all. They are just human beings, same as you.\\n\\nAnd, here\\u2019s the cool part. The ones you most want to reach are probably a lot like you. If you\\u2019ve written a book, it\\u2019s probably the kind of book you like to read. And if you\\u2019d like to read it, then that means that other people like you would probably like to read it.\\n\\nSo all you have to do is think for a minute about how someone who has written a book like yours could reach you.\\n\\nWhat would make you want to read your own book?\\n\\nWhat makes you tell a friend oh, my God, you have to read this?\\n\\nWhat makes you click a link, instead of scrolling by?\\n\\nWhat makes you share?\\n\\nThe reason why marketing gets a bad rap is because so many people use it like a sledgehammer, when really, it\\u2019s more like a Post-it note. No one wants to get smashed over the head. But who doesn\\u2019t want the exact right thing stuck right where they need it?\\n\\nIntroverts have trouble being sledgehammers. All we want to do is go home and get in our pajamas! We don\\u2019t want to hit anyone over the head with our books or anything else.\\n\\nBut we can stick a little reminder in the right place. A friendly little note that says Oh, hi! I wrote this thing. I think you\\u2019re going to love it.\\n\\nAnd sometimes the sledgehammer is easy to ignore \\u2014 because we\\u2019re so used to dodging them. But those sticky notes, man. If you use them right, they\\u2019re wonderful. They make you pay attention.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t be slimy.\\n\\nThis should be obvious, but we both know it\\u2019s not.\\n\\nWe know, because there are so many people out there willing to take $299 from us to teach us how to be slimy.\\n\\nYou don\\u2019t have to trick people into buying your book. You don\\u2019t have to slip in under the radar. You don\\u2019t need to get fake bestseller statuses or elevate your social validation or whatever.\\n\\nAuthenticity is addictive. It\\u2019s your best asset.\\n\\nWhen you spend money, make it count.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re an indie writer, learn how to use Amazon ads properly. Dave Chesson has a free course in how to that over at Kindlepreneur.\\n\\nThe best money you can spend as a writer is on a decent email server. I like Convertkit. Start building your email list today. I\\u2019ve written a ton about email list building for writers, but you can start here.\\n\\nBryan Harris at Growth Tools (they used to be Videofruit) has a ton of amazing ideas for email list building that he offers for free. Just free. When I first started, I just took Bryan\\u2019s ideas one at a time and did the work.\\n\\nIt was hard. Because I\\u2019m an introvert and none of this shit is easy for me. But I did it and it worked. And it got easier.\\n\\nYou do not need to spend a lot of money on fancy ads or on schemes to make yourself a \\u201cbestseller\\u201d in a boxed set or hiring publicists. You do not need more than a simple website that you are probably capable of building yourself .\\n\\nHello, there. You should be blogging.\\n\\nYou\\u2019re a writer. Words are your currency and your most available tool.\\n\\nI feel like I\\u2019m stating the obvious here, but you should be blogging.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re a novelist, you might get a book into your reader\\u2019s hands once a year give or take. Maybe. But with a blog, you can reach out to your readers any time you want to. Every week. Every day. Every time you have an idea.\\n\\nYou can be in conversation with them. And let me tell you, that\\u2019s some exciting stuff. It\\u2019s thrilling. If you give you readers a way to start following you, you\\u2019ll start to notice that some of them are hardcore. They always show up for you.\\n\\nThey read what you write. They always read what you write.\\n\\nIf you have any doubt that your introverted self needs that, let me help you put that at rest.\\n\\nYou need it. Everyone needs it. It\\u2019s the good stuff.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. It\\u2019s why you\\u2019re reading this article instead of happily writing in your journal or filing your short stories away on your hard drive.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why you care whether or not anyone reads your work.\\n\\nWhile we\\u2019re on the subject, please do not only blog about your own writing. No one wants to read that. It\\u2019s boring.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t believe me, ask yourself this question: How many author blogs do you read that only talk about the author\\u2019s process?\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nYou are an interesting person. There are things you\\u2019re interested in. You\\u2019re good at things. There are things you want to be good at. Write about those things.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find your people. I promise.\\n\\nRemember that marketing has nothing to do with the quality of your work.\\n\\nIf you find yourself saying if I was good enough, I wouldn\\u2019t need to market I want you to do something for me.\\n\\nGo to a mirror and look yourself squarely in the face. Now tell yourself to stop it. Right now.\\n\\nYou are wrong. And I swear, this is one of those times when if everyone would just listen to me, the world would be a happier place. Because there is exactly zero correlation between the quality of your work and the necessity for marketing.\\n\\nThe fact that you need to market your work does not mean that you\\u2019re a shitty writer, just because you heard once that someone else doesn\\u2019t have an email list and never markets anything.\\n\\nEveryone needs to market their work. The very, very few lucky souls who have somehow been able to count on luck to give them a career \\u2014 we can\\u2019t recreate their success.\\n\\nHell, they can\\u2019t recreate their success.\\n\\nThat means that you\\u2019re normal and they\\u2019re weird.\\n\\nSince you can\\u2019t predict being at the exact right place at the exact right time with the exact right piece of work \\u2014 you\\u2019re going to have to count on your own ability to let people know you\\u2019ve written a thing.\\n\\nIf you do manage to get struck by lightning, awesome. But two things. One \\u2014 since you didn\\u2019t hitch your wagon to that star, you won\\u2019t be dependent on it, so if at some point it stops dragging you along, you\\u2019ll be fine. Two \\u2014 even those lucky few who don\\u2019t have to market their work would do even better if they knew how to reach out to their readers.\\n\\nI mean, do you really, really want to be the writer who gets to be famous and never has to interact with the people who love them? Are you sure about that?\\n\\nBecause that sounds pretty lonely to me. There\\u2019s a difference between lonely and introverted.\\n\\nIt also sounds like the excuse we use to let ourselves off the marketing hook because marketing is hard, especially for introverts, and we don\\u2019t want to do it.\\n\\nThe need to market your work doesn\\u2019t make you less of a writer, because there is no correlation between the quality of your writing and the need or lack of need for marketing.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t believe me, go pick up a copy of 50 Shades of Grey. Or go pick up any National Book Award winner that\\u2019s sold less than 5000 copies.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s okay to focus on the parts that are easier for you.\\n\\nI like blogging. I\\u2019m pretty good at Facebook. I adore my email list. Email marketing is my sweetspot. When I reach out to my email list, I feel like I\\u2019m talking to friends.\\n\\nI suck at video, but I\\u2019m working at it and I\\u2019m getting better. If there are other people there, I can do it pretty well. I still haven\\u2019t mastered video when it\\u2019s just me talking into a camera. I end up sounding like a lunatic.\\n\\nI can do an ad if I have to, but I\\u2019m not a great copywriter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s my skillset. Yours is probably different.\\n\\nAnd that\\u2019s okay. No one is good at everything. And no one has to be.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re great at audio, then do audio. If video is your thing, figure out how to market with video. If you\\u2019re completely inexperienced, pick something and just start. It\\u2019s okay if you suck at the beginning.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a secret for you: in the beginning, no one\\u2019s paying attention anyway.\\n\\nThe few people who will see your early efforts at marketing won\\u2019t care if you screw up. So take a deep breath and don\\u2019t worry so much. Stick your nose out of your introverted writer\\u2019s lair and accept that you\\u2019re going to have to give some form of marketing a shot.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll get better at this.\\n\\nIt might not seem like it now, but marketing is a skill and like any other skill, the more you do it, the better you\\u2019ll get at it. Even if the idea of marketing makes you want to hide under your covers.\\n\\nEventually you\\u2019ll understand how ads work. You\\u2019ll be a master blogger. You\\u2019ll know how to write an email to your followers without sounding like a robot. You\\u2019ll look up one day and realize that you actually like that conversation between you and your readers.\\n\\nMaybe it won\\u2019t ever be your favorite thing. Maybe you\\u2019ll dream about the day when you\\u2019re rich and famous enough to pass it off to someone else. (But, when you get there, you\\u2019ll only have more marketing to do!)\\n\\nBut you will get better at it.\\n\\nHere are a few first steps.\",\n          \"Apple\\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg beamed into a congressional hearing via video chat today to face 4+ hours of questions about whether they abuse their dominant positions in the market. Spoiler: they said everything\\u2019s cool.\\n\\nBy Chloe Albanesius & Michael Kan\\n\\nThe CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.\\n\\nSpoiler: They all said they don\\u2019t.\\n\\nAs you\\u2019d expect, Apple\\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn\\u2019t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.\\n\\nMembers on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook\\u2019s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple\\u2019s fabled walled-garden approach persists.\\n\\nSome Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon\\u2019s JEDI project; and why a certain member\\u2019s campaign emails keep ending up in his father\\u2019s spam folder.\\n\\nThe four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nFacebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?\\n\\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.\\n\\n\\u201cIn your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,\\u201d Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. \\u201cWhy should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. \\u201cI think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would\\u2019ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\\u201d he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.\\n\\nAccording to Zuckerberg, Instagram\\u2019s success is largely due to Facebook\\u2019s investment. \\u201cI think this has been an American success story,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nNadler disagreed. \\u201cRather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\\n\\nAre You Threatening Me?\\n\\nNadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg\\u2019s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.\\n\\n\\u201cIn a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook \\u2018was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,\\u2019\\u201d Rep. Jayapal noted. \\u201cInstagram\\u2019s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into \\u2018destroy mode\\u2019 if he didn\\u2019t sell Instagram to you.\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. \\u201cI think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nPreventing Imminent Risk of Life\\n\\nTwitter was not present at today\\u2019s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president\\u2019s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.\\n\\nThe video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn\\u2019t one, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\\u201cIn general\\u2026we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,\\u201d Zuckerberg continued. But if \\u201csomeone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug \\u2026 we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.\\u201d\\n\\nLater in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.\\n\\n\\u201cWe believe in freedom of expression and there\\u2019s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,\\u201d Pichai said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Text_Splitted\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"As an architect and the author of a book about the psychology of creative space design, I have long wondered why contemporary creatives cluster so willingly in noisy coffee shops. Granted, there\\u2019s scientific research that caffeine fuels the imagination, but doesn\\u2019t the surrounding din interfere with their ability to think creatively such that no amount of chemical stimulation can compensate for the distraction?\\n\\nCertainly, many eminent creatives from the past shunned clamor. Consider Marcel Proust. To remark that the French writer was sensitive to auditory interference would be an understatement. The man was positively neurotic about it. He treated the bedroom in his Paris apartment where he wrote like a sensory deprivation chamber \\u2014 shutters closed, drapes drawn, the walls lined with sound-absorbing cork. It wasn\\u2019t enough. He wore earplugs too.\\n\\nAnton Chekhov was similarly beset by hypersensitivity to sound. So was fellow obsessive Frank Kafka, who described his condition in his signature surreal style by saying that \\u201cI need solitude for my writing; not \\u2018like a hermit\\u2019 \\u2014 that wouldn\\u2019t be enough \\u2014 but like a dead man.\\u201d Sadly, by the time he got his wish, it was too late to do anything about it.\\n\\nThe correlation between high-level inventiveness and difficulty in filtering out sensory inputs is understandable, given that open-mindedness is a hallmark of the creative personality. The problem for off-the-chart geniuses like Proust, Chekhov, and Kafka was that their minds were a bit too open. Everything got through. Hence the extreme measures they took to avoid being immobilized by incoming stimuli.\\n\\nFig. 1: Optimal noise levels for creative processing compared to other conditions. After Ravi Mehta, Rui (Juliet) Zhu, and Amar Cheema (2012). Illustration by the author. From My Creative Space: How to Design Your Home to Stimulate Ideas and Spark Innovation.\\n\\nThen again, most of us aren\\u2019t Marcel Proust. According to research data from 2012, people generally reach peak performance under moderately noisy conditions \\u2014 70db (decibels), to be precise. It just so happens that this is roughly equivalent to the chatter in a typical coffee shop or restaurant on a relatively busy day (Fig. 1).\\n\\nAs to why this is the case, the scientists who authored the study offer a theory:\\n\\nWe theorize that a moderate (vs. low) level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty, which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance. A high level of noise, however, reduces the extent of information processing, thus impairing creativity.\\n\\nTranslation: silence isn\\u2019t as golden as it sounds. Absolute noiselessness tends to focus our attention, which is helpful for tasks that entail accuracy, fine detail, and linear reasoning, such as balancing our checkbook or fixing a Swiss watch. It\\u2019s less supportive of the broad, big-picture, abstract mind-wandering that leads to fresh perspectives and a creative work product. On the other hand, excessive noise overwhelms our sensory apparatus and hinders our ability to properly process information at all. In between lies the sweet spot \\u2014 noise not so loud that we can\\u2019t hear ourselves think, and not so quiet that we can\\u2019t help but hear ourselves think.\\n\\nLiving room and fountain details. Bellevue, Washington. Architecture by David Coleman Architecture. Interior design by Elizabeth Stretch for Stretch Design. Photography by Paul Warchol.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a caveat to the data, however: the noise has to be white. For the record, the technical definition of white noise is noise containing multiple frequencies with equal intensities. More colloquially, the phrase refers to a constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds, and which takes the form of meaningless or distracting commotion, hubbub, or chatter.\\n\\nWhy is it important that the noise be white? Because otherwise you\\u2019re prone to tune into and attempt to discern the source and meaning of the sound, which diverts too much of your conscious attention from your task to be a useful tool for diffuse thinking.\\n\\nHow to Make Noise When There Isn\\u2019t Any\\n\\nHow can we creative mortals who don\\u2019t care for the smell of coffee, lack the funds to construct an oceanside villa, or live in urban environments where trees are scant benefit from the finding that a particular type and level of noise can promote insights? Here are a few options to consider:\\n\\nGet the app. Yes, Virginia, there really is an app for everything. Use the search term \\u201cnoise\\u201d to bring up dozens of sound generating programs in your smartphone\\u2019s app store. You\\u2019ll also see a broad selection of metering apps for measuring decibel levels at home.\\n\\nSome of the app companies operate websites that let you download audio files of white noise soundtracks onto your computer or play them directly through a browser. A couple of my favorite sites include Raining.fm, which offers tracks simulating \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 downpours, rolling thunder, and heavy thunderstorms, and Coffitivy, which specializes in \\u2014 what else? \\u2014 coffee shop buzz.\\n\\nLiving room. Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Architecture and interior design by Richard Davignon and Doris Martin for Davignon Martin Architecture + Interior Design. Photography by Eymeric Widling.\\n\\nGet or hack a sound generator. Another option is to purchase a desktop appliance designed to emit white noise. They\\u2019re smallish devices, typically placed on night tables and in babies\\u2019 rooms to help occupants fall asleep. For an architectural solution, think about installing an indoor or outdoor fountain \\u2014 few things in life are as pleasantly hypnotizing as the mellifluous whoosh of water descending onto water. Price points run the gamut from low-cost store-bought products to sky\\u2019s-the-limit custom installations.\\n\\nDIY contrivances also abound; consult the Internet for guidance.\\n\\nLet in or keep out external noise. City dwellers and people who reside along busy highways might have a ready-made noise machine right outside their window: road traffic. Open your windows to varying degrees or use sound muffling, such as drapery, to see if you can calibrate ambient noise to fall within the optimal range.\\n\\nA less cacophonous strategy for harnessing exterior sounds would be to park yourself on a bench or beach that lies within earshot of ocean waves. It\\u2019s like having an always-on fountain, only bigger.\\n\\nListen to music. Like noise, music can have a positive effect on idea formation, while affording the listener far greater pleasure than the usual restaurant ruckus. But music is a huge subject in itself, and so must wait for another article!\",\n          \"An introvert is a person who recharges when they are alone. Being around other people depletes their energy, being by themselves renews it.\\n\\nWriting is such solitary, interior work that it tends to attract introverts. We work well alone. And if we happen to have a little bit of ambivert in us \\u2014 if we like to be around other people some \\u2014 well, that\\u2019s okay. We have our characters to keep us company.\\n\\nBut it\\u2019s very, very rare to find a writer who gets excited about the part of the business of writing that requires a more extroverted personality. You know, the part where you have to stick your nose out of your writing cave and let other humans know you\\u2019re alive.\\n\\nUh, huh. Marketing.\\n\\nUgh. Marketing. It\\u2019s hard for everyone, but for introverts? For introverts, marketing is torture.\\n\\nEvery now and then I come across someone for whom the stars have aligned and they\\u2019ve managed to find success (sometimes incredible success) without the need for a lot of marketing and they just kind of shrug and say Oh, marketing? I don\\u2019t like it, so I just don\\u2019t do it. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s necessary.\\n\\nAnd I want to throat punch them. Metaphorically. Because I wouldn\\u2019t really throat punch anyone. I\\u2019m a pacifist.\\n\\nBut come on.\\n\\nOne percent of writers write the right thing at the right time and get it out in the right place, in front of the right people, and bam! Magic happens. They get rich and famous and they never have to market anything.\\n\\nHow nice for them. But counting on being one of those people is not a very good career plan.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s kind of like deciding you want to be an actress, so you start to hang out in soda shops, hoping to be discovered because it worked for Lana Turner.\\n\\nI really wish that the people who managed to find their way onto that magical path would at least acknowledge that it probably won\\u2019t work for almost anyone else. Because it won\\u2019t.\\n\\nNinety-nine percent of writers have to learn how to market, even if they are introverts who would rather seriously consider a career in accounting than think about marketing their own work.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what you need to know about marketing.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nMarketing is just a conversation between you and your readers. If you can remember that, then you can manage your fear about it. It\\u2019s not a magic trick. It\\u2019s not a technique or a tactic or a strategy.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s just a conversation.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s you reaching out to readers who are into what you\\u2019re writing and letting them know that you\\u2019ve written a thing that they might be interested in. That\\u2019s all. And that\\u2019s not so scary.\\n\\nWhen you post a link to social media, you aren\\u2019t bothering anyone. You\\u2019re giving other people the opportunity to read something they might enjoy. If they aren\\u2019t into it, they\\u2019ll scroll past. No harm done.\\n\\nAnd trust me, they\\u2019ll scroll. (Same as you scroll past hundreds of links a day. Maybe thousands.)\\n\\nWhen you run an ad, you\\u2019re reaching out to other people just like you.\\n\\nYou aren\\u2019t shoving your work up their noses. You aren\\u2019t being pushy or obnoxious. You\\u2019re doing what you\\u2019re supposed to do. You\\u2019re letting readers know that you\\u2019ve written something for them.\\n\\nAnd if you do it right, you\\u2019re letting readers who have asked to be made aware know that you\\u2019ve written something. You\\u2019re not bombarding everyone in creation. You\\u2019re putting your link in front of people who follow you or who have read other things like what you\\u2019ve written or who are interested in your topic.\\n\\nDeep breath. This is part of your job, and it\\u2019s okay to do it.\\n\\nReaders are just people.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s all. They are just human beings, same as you.\\n\\nAnd, here\\u2019s the cool part. The ones you most want to reach are probably a lot like you. If you\\u2019ve written a book, it\\u2019s probably the kind of book you like to read. And if you\\u2019d like to read it, then that means that other people like you would probably like to read it.\\n\\nSo all you have to do is think for a minute about how someone who has written a book like yours could reach you.\\n\\nWhat would make you want to read your own book?\\n\\nWhat makes you tell a friend oh, my God, you have to read this?\\n\\nWhat makes you click a link, instead of scrolling by?\\n\\nWhat makes you share?\\n\\nThe reason why marketing gets a bad rap is because so many people use it like a sledgehammer, when really, it\\u2019s more like a Post-it note. No one wants to get smashed over the head. But who doesn\\u2019t want the exact right thing stuck right where they need it?\\n\\nIntroverts have trouble being sledgehammers. All we want to do is go home and get in our pajamas! We don\\u2019t want to hit anyone over the head with our books or anything else.\\n\\nBut we can stick a little reminder in the right place. A friendly little note that says Oh, hi! I wrote this thing. I think you\\u2019re going to love it.\\n\\nAnd sometimes the sledgehammer is easy to ignore \\u2014 because we\\u2019re so used to dodging them. But those sticky notes, man. If you use them right, they\\u2019re wonderful. They make you pay attention.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t be slimy.\\n\\nThis should be obvious, but we both know it\\u2019s not.\\n\\nWe know, because there are so many people out there willing to take $299 from us to teach us how to be slimy.\\n\\nYou don\\u2019t have to trick people into buying your book. You don\\u2019t have to slip in under the radar. You don\\u2019t need to get fake bestseller statuses or elevate your social validation or whatever.\\n\\nAuthenticity is addictive. It\\u2019s your best asset.\\n\\nWhen you spend money, make it count.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re an indie writer, learn how to use Amazon ads properly. Dave Chesson has a free course in how to that over at Kindlepreneur.\\n\\nThe best money you can spend as a writer is on a decent email server. I like Convertkit. Start building your email list today. I\\u2019ve written a ton about email list building for writers, but you can start here.\\n\\nBryan Harris at Growth Tools (they used to be Videofruit) has a ton of amazing ideas for email list building that he offers for free. Just free. When I first started, I just took Bryan\\u2019s ideas one at a time and did the work.\\n\\nIt was hard. Because I\\u2019m an introvert and none of this shit is easy for me. But I did it and it worked. And it got easier.\\n\\nYou do not need to spend a lot of money on fancy ads or on schemes to make yourself a \\u201cbestseller\\u201d in a boxed set or hiring publicists. You do not need more than a simple website that you are probably capable of building yourself .\\n\\nHello, there. You should be blogging.\\n\\nYou\\u2019re a writer. Words are your currency and your most available tool.\\n\\nI feel like I\\u2019m stating the obvious here, but you should be blogging.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re a novelist, you might get a book into your reader\\u2019s hands once a year give or take. Maybe. But with a blog, you can reach out to your readers any time you want to. Every week. Every day. Every time you have an idea.\\n\\nYou can be in conversation with them. And let me tell you, that\\u2019s some exciting stuff. It\\u2019s thrilling. If you give you readers a way to start following you, you\\u2019ll start to notice that some of them are hardcore. They always show up for you.\\n\\nThey read what you write. They always read what you write.\\n\\nIf you have any doubt that your introverted self needs that, let me help you put that at rest.\\n\\nYou need it. Everyone needs it. It\\u2019s the good stuff.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. It\\u2019s why you\\u2019re reading this article instead of happily writing in your journal or filing your short stories away on your hard drive.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s why you care whether or not anyone reads your work.\\n\\nWhile we\\u2019re on the subject, please do not only blog about your own writing. No one wants to read that. It\\u2019s boring.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t believe me, ask yourself this question: How many author blogs do you read that only talk about the author\\u2019s process?\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nYou are an interesting person. There are things you\\u2019re interested in. You\\u2019re good at things. There are things you want to be good at. Write about those things.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find your people. I promise.\\n\\nRemember that marketing has nothing to do with the quality of your work.\\n\\nIf you find yourself saying if I was good enough, I wouldn\\u2019t need to market I want you to do something for me.\\n\\nGo to a mirror and look yourself squarely in the face. Now tell yourself to stop it. Right now.\\n\\nYou are wrong. And I swear, this is one of those times when if everyone would just listen to me, the world would be a happier place. Because there is exactly zero correlation between the quality of your work and the necessity for marketing.\\n\\nThe fact that you need to market your work does not mean that you\\u2019re a shitty writer, just because you heard once that someone else doesn\\u2019t have an email list and never markets anything.\\n\\nEveryone needs to market their work. The very, very few lucky souls who have somehow been able to count on luck to give them a career \\u2014 we can\\u2019t recreate their success.\\n\\nHell, they can\\u2019t recreate their success.\\n\\nThat means that you\\u2019re normal and they\\u2019re weird.\\n\\nSince you can\\u2019t predict being at the exact right place at the exact right time with the exact right piece of work \\u2014 you\\u2019re going to have to count on your own ability to let people know you\\u2019ve written a thing.\\n\\nIf you do manage to get struck by lightning, awesome. But two things. One \\u2014 since you didn\\u2019t hitch your wagon to that star, you won\\u2019t be dependent on it, so if at some point it stops dragging you along, you\\u2019ll be fine. Two \\u2014 even those lucky few who don\\u2019t have to market their work would do even better if they knew how to reach out to their readers.\\n\\nI mean, do you really, really want to be the writer who gets to be famous and never has to interact with the people who love them? Are you sure about that?\\n\\nBecause that sounds pretty lonely to me. There\\u2019s a difference between lonely and introverted.\\n\\nIt also sounds like the excuse we use to let ourselves off the marketing hook because marketing is hard, especially for introverts, and we don\\u2019t want to do it.\\n\\nThe need to market your work doesn\\u2019t make you less of a writer, because there is no correlation between the quality of your writing and the need or lack of need for marketing.\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t believe me, go pick up a copy of 50 Shades of Grey. Or go pick up any National Book Award winner that\\u2019s sold less than 5000 copies.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s okay to focus on the parts that are easier for you.\\n\\nI like blogging. I\\u2019m pretty good at Facebook. I adore my email list. Email marketing is my sweetspot. When I reach out to my email list, I feel like I\\u2019m talking to friends.\\n\\nI suck at video, but I\\u2019m working at it and I\\u2019m getting better. If there are other people there, I can do it pretty well. I still haven\\u2019t mastered video when it\\u2019s just me talking into a camera. I end up sounding like a lunatic.\\n\\nI can do an ad if I have to, but I\\u2019m not a great copywriter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s my skillset. Yours is probably different.\\n\\nAnd that\\u2019s okay. No one is good at everything. And no one has to be.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re great at audio, then do audio. If video is your thing, figure out how to market with video. If you\\u2019re completely inexperienced, pick something and just start. It\\u2019s okay if you suck at the beginning.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a secret for you: in the beginning, no one\\u2019s paying attention anyway.\\n\\nThe few people who will see your early efforts at marketing won\\u2019t care if you screw up. So take a deep breath and don\\u2019t worry so much. Stick your nose out of your introverted writer\\u2019s lair and accept that you\\u2019re going to have to give some form of marketing a shot.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll get better at this.\\n\\nIt might not seem like it now, but marketing is a skill and like any other skill, the more you do it, the better you\\u2019ll get at it. Even if the idea of marketing makes you want to hide under your covers.\\n\\nEventually you\\u2019ll understand how ads work. You\\u2019ll be a master blogger. You\\u2019ll know how to write an email to your followers without sounding like a robot. You\\u2019ll look up one day and realize that you actually like that conversation between you and your readers.\\n\\nMaybe it won\\u2019t ever be your favorite thing. Maybe you\\u2019ll dream about the day when you\\u2019re rich and famous enough to pass it off to someone else. (But, when you get there, you\\u2019ll only have more marketing to do!)\\n\\nBut you will get better at it.\\n\\nHere are a few first steps.\",\n          \"Apple\\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg beamed into a congressional hearing via video chat today to face 4+ hours of questions about whether they abuse their dominant positions in the market. Spoiler: they said everything\\u2019s cool.\\n\\nBy Chloe Albanesius & Michael Kan\\n\\nThe CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.\\n\\nSpoiler: They all said they don\\u2019t.\\n\\nAs you\\u2019d expect, Apple\\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn\\u2019t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.\\n\\nMembers on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook\\u2019s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple\\u2019s fabled walled-garden approach persists.\\n\\nSome Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon\\u2019s JEDI project; and why a certain member\\u2019s campaign emails keep ending up in his father\\u2019s spam folder.\\n\\nThe four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nFacebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?\\n\\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.\\n\\n\\u201cIn your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,\\u201d Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. \\u201cWhy should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. \\u201cI think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would\\u2019ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\\u201d he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.\\n\\nAccording to Zuckerberg, Instagram\\u2019s success is largely due to Facebook\\u2019s investment. \\u201cI think this has been an American success story,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nNadler disagreed. \\u201cRather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\\n\\nAre You Threatening Me?\\n\\nNadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg\\u2019s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.\\n\\n\\u201cIn a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook \\u2018was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,\\u2019\\u201d Rep. Jayapal noted. \\u201cInstagram\\u2019s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into \\u2018destroy mode\\u2019 if he didn\\u2019t sell Instagram to you.\\u201d\\n\\nZuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. \\u201cI think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nPreventing Imminent Risk of Life\\n\\nTwitter was not present at today\\u2019s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president\\u2019s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.\\n\\nThe video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn\\u2019t one, Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\\u201cIn general\\u2026we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,\\u201d Zuckerberg continued. But if \\u201csomeone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug \\u2026 we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.\\u201d\\n\\nLater in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.\\n\\n\\u201cWe believe in freedom of expression and there\\u2019s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,\\u201d Pichai said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Classical_Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"As an architect and author on creative space design, the writer explores the psychology behind creative individuals' preference for working in moderately noisy environments, like coffee shops.

It's also crucial to remember that the need for marketing doesn't reflect the quality of one's work; even the best writers need to market.
